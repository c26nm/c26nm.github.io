<p>Hi! My name is Natalia and I am a freshman at Dalton. I took the class Computer Science 1 because I was told it was very fun and I highly enjoyed Computer Science last year. I love making this website and I hope you enjoy it as well. I like to play volleyball outside of school and I play for a club team as well as Dalton's Varsity Volleyball team I moved from Miami to New York City in 4th grade and I love living here. My favorite subject in school is history because I like learning about how people lived years ago. My favorite day of the week is Friday because the next day we do not have school but I also love Wednesdays because I barely have classes. My favorite food is crispy rice preferably with spicy tuna on top. I love sushi as well. I like to watch basketball, hockey, football, baseball, college volleyball, and the World Cup! Go Brazil!! I hope you all enjoy my website!</p>
