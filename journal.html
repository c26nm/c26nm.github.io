<h2>NATALIA'S JOURNALðŸ˜Ž</h2>

<p>During the first couple comp sci classes we ahve learned how to do some basic things. We intially downloaded sublime text which is where we can add stuff to our websites. We have an index page, a journal page, and a projects page which I will be adding to as soon as we start something in class. I love comp sci so far!</p>

<p>This week we've only had one comp sci class because we had a day off yesterday. I learned how to use the .button function in Sublime Text. I made my background lavender and my text white. Miya is helping me because sometimes I am a little confused but she keeps me on track! I want to add some shapes in my background which would be very cute. I am trying to make my website look cuter but there are many different things I could do so it is hard to choose. I hope that it will be more appealing in a couple of days because right now it looks hella ugly.</p>

<p>Today in class, we learmed how to open a console and we started using JavaScript. We learned about what a string is and we also watched catdog. Also we messed around with variables. We watched Rocko's Modern Life and the music is kind of good to be honest. I am working on my animation but I am legit confused so I am asking Miya for help.</p>

I added it to my projects page but I still have to write on the page: "Click around for a surprise". Now I will list some key vocabulary. A variable is a storage location in JavaScript. In a variable you can store code that happens when you run it. A function has to have an input and an output. A function is a group of statements that performs some task. A string is a sequence of characters. For example, "Natalia" is a sequence of n, a, t, a, l, i, a. A number in coding is </p>

<p>An Event Listener is a way that makes it so when you click around the page, the code that you have runs or an action happens. Events are actions that are happening in the code and the system tells you what is happening in your code so you can change it or make it different. To show up in the console are double click and press inspect and you click the screen and these numbers come up. To get it into the console you have to write "{console.log(event.clientX, event.clientY)})".</p>
