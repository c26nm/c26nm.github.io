<h1>Natalia's Journal</h1>
<h2>October 3, 2022</h2>
<p>During the first couple comp sci classes we ahve learned how to do some basic things. We intially downloaded sublime text which is where we can add stuff to our websites. We have an index page, a journal page, and a projects page which I will be adding to as soon as we start something in class. I love comp sci so far!</p>
<h2>October 6, 2022</h2>
<p>This week we've only had one comp sci class because we had a day off yesterday. I learned how to use the .button function in Sublime Text. I made my background lavender and my text white. Miya is helping me because sometimes I am a little confused but she keeps me on track! I want to add some shapes in my background which would be very cute. I am trying to make my website look cuter but there are many different things I could do so it is hard to choose. I hope that it will be more appealing in a couple of days because right now it looks hella ugly:((</p>
